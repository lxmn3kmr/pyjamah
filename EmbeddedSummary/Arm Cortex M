Memory map in the manual. 

Flash memory - usually code memory. immune to power cycle.
SRAM - temp calculations are made in RAM. volatile memory

UART/USART
USART registers - SR StatusRegister, DR DataRegister
Programmers Model - 
  Instruction Set, Registers, CPU functionality, FPU, 
 

HCI - Host Control Interface layer. 

Eg: a CPU gives commands to BT chip to scan. BT chip does some processing. Requires multiple tasks scheduling. Which can be done on RTOS. 
It needs a scheduler. Each task is a statemachine. 

RTOS - https://github.com/FreeRTOS/FreeRTOS-Kernel

RTOS is written in C. Application implemention in RTOS is state machine implementation. Each task is a statemachine.
