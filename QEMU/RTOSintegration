add RTOS files individually and get it compiled
Config parameters and Port functions needs to be implemented by user

CPU Clock - 8MHz
Timer clock - 10 --> 10 times in 1 sec

  
vTaskScheduler() in start.c will start task scheduler.

xTaskCreate(vtask1, "T1", stacksize, NULL, 1, NULL) - create tasks before scheduler. 

task creation failed due to mem allocation failure. New TCB is NULL.  Task Control Block. - fn ptr, stack, metadata.
taskcreate -> createtask-> PortMalloc ->  heap initialization failed. we were writing into Read only memory and hence heap creation variables are 0.

data and bss section handling in linker script. 

The .bss section (Block Started by Symbol) is a segment within an executable or object file that holds uninitialized global and static variables. 
When a program is loaded into memory, the operating system or loader allocates memory for the .bss section and initializes its contents to zero before the program's execution begins
